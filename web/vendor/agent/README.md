# Vendored agent runtime

`agent-runtime.js` is the assistant runtime for the plain web build
(`tools/serve_web.sh`), which has no bundler. It is an esbuild bundle of
`mobile/src/agent-runtime.mjs`, so the terminal can offer the assistant without
npm, a build step, or internet access.

Do not edit the generated files by hand:

```sh
tools/build_agent_bundle.sh
```

That command rewrites all three files below. Run it after changing
`mobile/src/agent-runtime.mjs`, `mobile/src/pi-agent.mjs`, any `web/` module they
import, or after upgrading the packages in `mobile/package.json`.

- `agent-runtime.js`: ESM bundle, browser target, minified, license comments
  kept at the end of the file.
- `LICENSES.txt`: attribution for every bundled package.
- `BUILD.json`: entry, esbuild version, bundled package versions and the bundle
  digest, so a stale artifact is detectable (`mobile/test/agent_bundle.test.mjs`).

The Vite (Capacitor) and ArkWeb builds do not use this bundle: they alias
`web/agent_runtime.js` to the source runtime and bundle it themselves.

## Notes

- The bundle is fetched only when a question is asked, so the terminal keeps its
  original load time. All three provider adapters are included, which is why the
  artifact is 979 KiB minified (252 KiB gzip) where an OpenAI-only bundle was
  488 KiB. The Vite and ArkWeb builds code-split it out of the initial download.
- Browser requests to the model endpoint are subject to CORS. Most hosted
  providers and local model servers (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) answer a
  browser origin directly; Anthropic needs the
  `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true` header, which the AI settings
  extra-headers field sends. Endpoints that refuse a browser origin need a proxy;
  the assistant reports that case explicitly.
